# podcasts-list-to-rss

Generate an RSS file from Telegram podcasts list

[bit.ly/podcasts-rss](https://bit.ly/podcasts-rss)

### What was done

- Read messages from Telegram channel
- Parse each message and get it's episode link 
- Find the RSS link of the podcast and get the RSS item from it
- Build an RSS file from all items from all messages
- Use the original episode XML item and just update those fields:
  - Publish date - use the Telegram published date instead of the original episode published date
  - Prepand to episode's description the Telegram message description from 
- Commit and save the RSS file 
- Run this flow each 1 hour using GitHub Actions


### Next steps

- Some messages are not well parsed and failing to get episode details
- Rememer last read message and read only newer messages
- Use bot token to listen to new messages instead. Now we use app token that has more permissions and can read all channel history
- Different between this repo (which should be a template) and a specific repo for each desired flow, that can be managed by each user who wants to use this flow
- Support more podcasts sites (currently support only Pocket Casts)
